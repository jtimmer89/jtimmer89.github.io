	<h1>Designing a great website</h1>

<div><img src="http://cdn-production.codecademy.com/assets/logo/logo--dark-blue-bf11002ce1caecdfb9fec8d3286b8a8d.svg" alt="Great website for learning code" width="30%" />
<blockquote style="border-left: 10px solid #D5D5D5;">Great website for learning code</blockquote></div>

<p>Codecademy&#39;s website has been growing on me ever since I started using it a couple months ago. With their refreshed design that was recently done, I think they are now my favorite website. It is so clean, and there is nothing unnecessary on the page. I love how it immediately brings up the last tutorial you were working on. Not only that, they have the other tutorials that have not been finished beneath the most recent one. As far as usability, that puts everything I need 95% of the time on the first screen that I go to. I don&#39;t have to waste time clicking around to get going on what I want to work on that day.</p>

<p>They also have really clean icons. I think icons are key for a good website. They need to trigger your mind to what they will bring up when clicked. They do a great job of using standard icons for certain programming languages while making the icons fit the colors and style of their site. Icons do a lot of work bringing the design of the site together as a whole because they are throughout many of the pages.</p>

<p>After spending time on codecademy, I feel like I have been very productive. They have great pop-ups for when you hit certain goals or finish any number of tasks. These pop-ups are clean and effective. There is no advertising or distraction. If I spend a day in the yard planting flowers or something, I feel extremely accomplished. If I spend a day on my computer, I don&#39;t always get this sense of accomplishment. However, on codecademy that is different because they have such great ways of indicating progress. I once heard that one need of the ADD person is that they need immediate stimulus in response to work they are doing. Mowing the lawn is good for an ADD person because they can see the work they have done, and it motivates them to keep getting things done. Codecademy is good in this way. It&#39;s clean design and progress indicators helps you feel like you are actually getting something done.</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 10px solid #D5D5D5;">For when it's time to buy something new</blockquote></div>

<p>Whenever I buy something, I spend a lot of time researching things. I could spend a couple days looking at different strollers. With so many websites reviewing things, I find myself constantly returning to wirecutter.com. They have a wide variety of things including electronics, home items, baby gear, and lots of other things. They cover a wide variety of things which is unusual for a website that focuses on reviews. There are lots of websites focusing on narrow topics, but nothing quite like wirecutter that I have found.</p>

<p>I think what makes the design effective is that they cover a pretty ridiculous amount of detail for every review, but they make it navigable in case you only have certain concerns. They looks at other major reviewers and who agrees with them in case you want that. They often give a cheaper option if you are on the cheap. They give a good summary at the end. They look at every angle you couple possibly want. With the font that they chose and the orange headers, I find it super easy to find the information that I want and nothing more. Then once you know you want to buy it, they even keep the best place to buy it from on the side. I used to open about 30 different tabs from different websites every time I was trying to find out what camera to get or whatever it may be. Using wirecutter has made things much simpler for me.</p>

<blockquote style="border-left: 10px solid #D5D5D5;">The place for quality videos</blockquote></div>

<p>After getting used to youtube, finding vimeo was like coming upon a serene mountain to spend some time after sitting in traffic. The first thing I notice is that they present a bunch of videos that I actually want to watch. They are all in good resolution, and they have a great grid with the videos that pulls your eyes through the different options. If you are looking for something specific, their section of categories is a great way to see the most popular videos in any category. Where youtube  seems to draw all the people to need to comment on how stupid something is and not really add any value, I think that vimeo&#39;s intent matches their design in that they draw serious people who have something worthwhile to say about a film or short. There is worthwhile commenting and communities growing on vimeo, and I just don&#39;t get that same feel on youtube, not that it doesn&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is just the most simple things that draw you in. I love the rainbow line at the top of the screen. If you go to the bottom of the home page, there is a blue horizontal bar with some text inside. The text is simple. The blue bar is just the right width. It is the million of design details done well that add up to a website that draws you to spend time where you feel like you are doing something productive or at least semi productive. Spendting time on vimeo feels semi-productive, like I am seeing things worth spending my time to watch and consider. There are too many sites where from poor design or poor intention, the site is just the old time suck. Vimeo goes a great job giving value to images in a world that is so image saturated.</p>
