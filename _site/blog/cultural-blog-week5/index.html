		<h1 id="the-pairing-process">The Pairing Process</h1>

<p>Pair programming is a big part of Dev Bootcamp. Pair programming is when you work with a partner to solve a technical problem. Each person assumes a certain role: navigator or driver. The navigator leads the driver in being helpful with syntax and googling any questions while the driver is actually typing the code and being in control of the keyboard/mouse. Peer pairing has changed for me throughout Phase 0, the first 9 weeks where we work primarily remotely on challenges to ensure that we still want to do DBC. Initially, I didn’t have much to offer, and I had to spend so much time researching for each problem that it was hard to be helpful. Peer pairing felt more like a study session where I was trying to communicate what I was doing the whole time, but that just made it harder to research the problem we wanted to solve. In one guided pairing session, I felt so confused by the content that I just barely made it through the session.</p>

<p>It hasn’t been all bad however. There have been small victories. I noticed how one person I paired with used IRB much more than myself, and I realized how helpful it was to test each part of your code as you go to ensure it is working as you think it is. This was not part of my work process, but it has now been hugely helpful. There are 3 kinds of pairing sessions I have experienced: you both have equal expertise, you have lesser expertise, or you have more expertise. When somebody is obviously more advanced than you, they can help facilitate your learning and guide you on the path also strengthening their own understanding of a given topic by guiding you on it. These are helpful but they can be a bit discouraging as I have felt that I should be further than I am, and it is hard to know if I am keeping up. There is a lot of grace in DBC, but they are also trying to ensure that you can make it and survive once on site. Honestly, there are some people that aren’t made for DBC. I don’t think I am that person, but sometimes I feel like it.</p>

<p>When you know more than the other person, hopefully it can be good to reinforce your own understanding of the problem. I have not really had this happen to me. I might know more about one thing, but I am pretty much a newbie at this juncture. If you are equal to the other person, I think that can be one of the most helpful pairing sessions. I had a session that felt pretty equal, and it was by far the most helpful of the sessions I have done. If somebody knows the answer, you might not be as quick to google something as you can just rely on them. However, when you are working with an equal, you have nothing to loose and you can just jump into the challenge trying all sorts of ideas. Working with somebody of closer knowledge to yourself can really help you breakthrough and grasp difficult concepts because you both have to work as hard and can get excited as you explore together. In the end, I would say peer pairing gets better with time, and there is probably each one of these three types of sessions that would be most helpful at certain junctures of learning. The best thing to do is pair with as many people as possible to pick up many styles and ideas. Don’t find yourself pairing with the same 3 people for example for all of Phase 0.</p>

<h2 id="feedbackinator">Feedbackinator</h2>

<p>Integrated with peer pairing is giving honest feedback to one another anonymously. DBC has a great feedback program that allows you to select your partner and give helpful feedback. Then that feedback is rated for kindness, actionability, and specificity or something like that. If it is kind, then it gets back to the person. After reading through and rating people’s feedback each week, it seems that the group is hesitant to to give feedback that would be considered negative. I think that part of the reason for that is that we are all so new to this and without really having relationships with these people, it is hard to give feedback on how they can do better next time. Without knowing what better could even look like, it’s not easy to give feedback on that. I think in unit 3, we will be able to give each other better feedback.</p>

<p>After reading through the feedback that I have been given, I felt encouraged. I personally feel a little drained by giving feedback. I have put it off even. It takes time to really consider feedback that is honest, kind, specific, helpful, and actionable. It seems that others must feel the same way because some of them are a bit sparse and unhelpful. With that said, it was very enlightening to receive feedback. I love it. I really enjoy knowing what others really think about me, and I love honesty. I know that there will be times I am being a jerk or unhelpful, and I hope people can tell me if I am. That never feels good, but I think it is hugely helpful. Based on the feedback that I got personally, I feel that I can better engage the pairing session by researching more. I think I had a more solid session today. I have assumed people know what to do and that I don’t. This has made me rely on them, without thinking through how I would do the problem. I think I would like to work on bringing my idea to the table and then moving forward after discussing so that I am truly present for the pairing duration. Once we get going and I understand what we are trying to do, I can check google and work on solving it for myself without depending on the other person as much.</p>

<p>The last thing I would say about the feedback is how beneficial it has been to rate other’s feedback. The reason for this is that I read about sessions that sound really awesome and super helpful, which allows me to recalibrate so to speak and think about how I can bring more to the table in the next session. I have been a bit hesitant about the sessions, but I am realizing there will always be things people don’t know, and I don’t have to worry about seeming slow. It’s better to just come to the challenge with all your ideas and work hard as you would if you were on your own.</p>
