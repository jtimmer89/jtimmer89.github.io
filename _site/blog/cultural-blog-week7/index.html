<p>When you think of the times in your life where you’ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values comes to mind?</p>

<p>Accomplishment Accountability Achievement Activism Adventure Affection Ambition Autonomy Challenge Close relationships Commitment Community Compassion Competence Competition Confidence Conformity Control Coolness under fire Cooperation Courage Creativity Credibility Decisiveness Economic security Effectiveness Efficiency Enthusiasm Environmentalism Excellence Excitement Fairness Faith Fame Free time Freedom Friendships Growth Having a family Health Helping other people Helping society Honesty Hospitality Independence Influence Inner harmony Insight Inspiration Integrity Intellectual status Introspection Justice Knowledge Leadership Location Loyalty Meaningful work Mentorship Merit Money Movement Music Nature Openness Order Patriotism Peace Persistance Personal development Physical challenge Pleasure Power and authority Privacy Public service Purity Quality Recognition Reputation Responsibility Romance Security Self-knowledge Self-reliance Self-respect Serenity Sophistication Spirituality Stability Status Tranquility Truth Vibrancy Volunteering Wealth Will-power Wisdom [add any that I missed]</p>

<p>Close relationships. Community. Compassion. Creativity. Effectiveness. Helping other people. Honesty. Personal development. Serenity. Vulnerability.</p>

<h2 id="release-2">Release 2</h2>

<p>Vulnerability/Honesty - I chose to write about vulnerability and honesty because they consistently rise to the top of the values that I have. It seems to me that part of the DBC philosophy is being able to observe what is coming out of you and the methods you might have for coping with stress, a challenging person, not understanding something, etc… The observation and awareness is the goal rather than trying to change or be different. It’s not that DBC doesn’t encourage change, but there is a large focus on the observation of what is naturally coming out of you rather than shame for being the way you are. I resonate pretty deeply with that, and I think that the natural overflow of observation is commonly vulnerability and honesty. There are moments when someone shares something that strikes a cord with all listening. It makes people uncomfortable and excited. Trying to be vulnerable doesn’t necessarily create it. It is something special, almost like a gift for the person sharing and the people listening. I value it because I lived so much of my life hidden, afraid to be exposed, motivated by fear. As I have come out of living a life to impress others and to be accepted, I have found vulnerability to be a place of freedom and delight.</p>

<h2 id="release-3">Release 3</h2>

<p>In general, I try to live up to these values:</p>

<p>Disagree 1 —– 2 —– 3 —– 4 —– 5 Agree</p>

<p><code>
  Close relationships - 5. 
  Community - 3 
  Compassion - 3 
  Creativity - 3 
  Effectiveness - 3 
  Helping other people - 3 
  Honesty - 5 
  Personal development - 4
  Serenity - 3
  Vulnerability - 5
</code></p>

<h2 id="release-4">Release 4</h2>

<p>The last thing that someone asked advice on was what to do in Michigan.</p>

<h2 id="release-5">Release 5</h2>

<p>I enjoy reflecting on my values, seeing how they have changed in even one year. I saw a cartoon that showed someone who filled their apartment with small balls like an old school McDonalds playground. When a visitor came to their place confused, the person responded by basically saying that the meaning of adulthood is getting to define what it means to be an adult.</p>

<div id="article-img"><a href="/media/cultural-blogs/grownups.png" target="_blank"><img src="/media/cultural-blogs/grownups.png" alt="Defining adulthood." width="100%" /></a>
<blockquote style="border-left: 10px solid #D5D5D5;">Defining adulthood.</blockquote></div>

<p>I found it funny and relevant because of shifting cultural values. It is kind of a time of pick your values and don’t judge anybody else. Looking at the early 1900s, it has been called a time of the cult of morality. Doing the right thing was king. Sometime with the arrival of Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” came the cult of personality. What this means is that the adults of one generation put the prize value on doing the right thing, and the next generation found this rightly stifling and contradictory as to who might define the right thing. With the cult of personality, charisma is king. However, it could be argued that there is a generation tired with fakes, tired of business people who are charming on the job and ass holes to their family. Post-modernity is one beast of an era that is trying to not be defined or put in a box. Therefore, I find it refreshing to consider my own values and put some boxes around the things that really make me tick for the sake of understanding myself and choosing a path that makes sense to who I am. In considering these values that stood out to me, I think that vulnerability and honesty can be key for mediating stereotype threat. Honesty can be best one on one, but in a culture of honesty, I see that being a good defense against the potential affects of stereotype threat.</p>
