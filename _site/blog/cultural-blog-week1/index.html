<p>In college, I found myself considering my own inner stress and the actual value in what I was accomplishing. The more that I thought about it, the more I began to feel and believe that there was little value in the content. It wasn’t going to help me much, and the way that it was being taught, I was not going to remember much of the actual content that was so important at the time. What was important was who I was becoming and the type of learner I was becoming. I realized that depending on who was my assessing my essay could determine whether or not I got an A or maybe even failed. If this whimsy exists, then why was I putting such emotional energy into my grades? I realized that what mattered is what happened before something was turned in. Did I put the effort that I wanted to in to what I was working on? It was about being in control on my own advancement and how I measured it. I began to experience the same emotional impact as an A or F when I finished a test based on the work I had done and the interactions that had occurred.</p>

<p>I think that something similar is going on here with what Shereef was saying. DBC can’t hand out some certificate that universally means something to the world. They actually have to create value, and they will live and die on whether or not employers see value in what they have taught people. University’s just give some practically imaginary status when you finish, but they aren’t truly under pressure to create value. How would this type of system not create laziness? It is inherently bad. Education is on the brink of revolution because of technology. Education on technology mine as well lead the way to a new paradigm of education.</p>

<p>I love the idea of owning what you are doing. It is way too easy to pass judgement on the teacher or chef who is supposed to be feeding you, but what is that accomplishing?! What good is happening when college students merely pass judgement on their experience and do whatever they need to just to pass the “standards.” It would be like writing tests for your code and only making sure they pass the tests but not making sure they are actually accomplishing their goals. That would be a waste of time, but that is what college can be like. There is definitely generalization in what I am saying, but I saw it too much to ignore it.</p>

<p>In business, you have to measure the impact of what you are doing and make sure you are adding value for others so that you can legitimately make money yourself. I think education has to be the same way. It is important to ponder what you are doing and learning and whether or not it is sustainable and impacting on your life. I think the problem is that we can be bad value assessors. We look at art, and we don’t always see the value in it. We want to try and count the numbers of values when value is a lot more fluid like water sometimes. I think the main thing is that as learners, we are doing are best to at least consider what we are doing and how to spend our time or what to work hard on. Education is mostly a system based on fear of getting a bad grade. Who cares though, really? We can all play by those rules and continue marching on, but I can’t help but consider the wasted money and time spent on educations that aren’t actually doing anything productive. The world needs innovative and good solutions in all areas, and I hope that this model can spread in unique ways to other arena’s of education. I am excited to see what DBC is like in person for these reasons.</p>
