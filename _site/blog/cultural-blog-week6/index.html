		<h1 id="confirming-a-negative">Confirming a Negative</h1>

<p>The idea of “Stereotype Threat” based on the research of Claude Steele is that when you are at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about a group you are a part of, your cognitive functioning is diverted to this stress and your actual performance on the given task suffers. I don’t know that this seems counterintuitive, but as I looked at the research to support this claim, I was very interested to consider it more deeply. A very challenging math test was given to equally qualified men and women that would stir up anxiety and challenge them. The women, though they were equally knowledgable in the problems, performed poorly compared to the men. Given this same situation, when the women were told this had no effect on the divide between men and women in math scores, women did equally well on the test. The idea is that if you give a math test that is challenging, it creates anxiety for both men and women, but for women who are stereotyped and told they don’t do as good on tests, they are at risk of confirming this negative stereotype. I explain that study because it reveals that the threat of confirming a stereotype is what leads to poor behavior. Tests are not always revealing reality. When you can remove the threat, you can begin to deal with the stereotype and maybe even destroy it in the long term.</p>

<p>I think what is also interesting about this idea is how it relates to everybody. When we think of stereotypes, the main category that comes to mind is race. As a white male in the United States, I don’t relate to racial minorities and their struggle. However, that is only one category of identity that can be considered in Stereotype Threat. A major situation in my own life that comes to mind is high school. I got a scholarship to go to a boarding school where my family background was considerably poorer than the kids that I went to school with. I think that I was concerned about confirming a certain stereotype that I might be of less value or interest than my classmates. Looking back, I now wonder if this didn’t affect the way that I interacted and my success in creating relationships. Looking back at each phase of life, there are friends that I would now connect with and be excited to see and catch up with. Since graduating from boarding school, I have made rare contacts with classmates, seen none of them in person, and I don’t know that I ever will except by chance. Why would it be that I have created close relationships through my time in other spheres of experience and location but not here? I believe I was impacted by the Stereotype Threat as it also happens to be when I felt this the most intensely.</p>

<p>I, by no means, would say this was traumatic or extremely challenging, but it was a painful time in my life and one I look back to often with curiosity about why it was so hard. The feelings of fear about not fitting in or confirming some negative stereotype related to my identity was an intense feeling. There are times I encounter these same feelings, but not as much in my primary spheres of life. I can only imagine the added stress and difficulty to perform well with this variable. I think that awareness of this threat is a huge first step. I hope that when recognizing that another colleague might be feeling this threat, I would be able to acknowledge and even pursue what their experience is like. If just one student asked me what it was like to be poorer than the rest of the students, that would have gone a long way to alleviate the pressure.</p>

<p>I think that each circumstance probably needs a unique response, but I personally love referencing case studies. They can open up dialogue without dumping opinion on someone. I think that the men and women study on math tests is a great short story to bring up acknowledging the way that this fear can affect performance and how the goal of assessing performance is not easy. The math tests did not represent the ability of the women. Realizing this and acknowledging it in public can help alleviate the pressure, that stereotypes are not there because they are real, but they can exist because of bullying and poor opinions of certain groups or identities. I have worked in a family business for the last 3 years, but I am curious to see what this could look like in whatever situation I happen to find myself in through the experience of DBC.</p>
