		<h2>CSS Explained: Margin, Borders, and Padding</h2>
		<img id="box" src="../unit1_projects/images/cssbox.gif" />
		<h3>Margin</h3>
		<p>Starting from the outermost of an html element, you have a css feature that will affect the positioning of other elements. This all makes sense when you realize that all elements in html are blocks. I have read that before but never understood it. It seemed so simple, but sometimes it takes a couple times before it clicks with wen development ideas. When you give some text header tags in html, it turns the white space around the text into a block. You can position this block and in turn the text with positioning as well as margin, borders, and padding. </p>
		<p>If you think of the outermost edge of the block as the border, you can add space between an element’s border and another element using margin. Let me illustrate.</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/websiteNoMargin.png" alt="No margin for Header">
			<figcaption><em>No margin for Header</em></figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="../unit1_projects/images/websiteWithMargin.png" alt="10px margin for Header">
			<figcaption><em>Then I added 10px of margin, and you can see the space around the left and top edge</em></figcaption>
		</figure>
		<h3>Border</h3>
		<p>The border principle is pretty straightforward. As we learned, each html element is a box, and we can add and play with the border around that box as following:</p>
		<p>p { border: 10px solid black; }</p>
		<p>This would create a 10 pixel solid black line around the paragraphs in the html document. You can play with the size, color, and add the line feature (solid, dotted, dashed, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset).</p>
		<h3>Padding</h3>
		<p>If we refer back up to the first picture, we can see that padding is the space around our content. If we added a large amount of padding, then added a border, that actual border box would ended up being far from the text or image. Padding and margin can be optimized with 4 characteristics: top, bottom, left, and right. There are two ways that you can adjust padding and margins. Let’s look at the different syntax for padding.</p>
		<p> padding-top: #px; <br> padding-right: #px; <br> padding-bottom: #px; <br> padding-left: #px;</p>
		<p>We can also user a shorter method that describes each side from top around to left moving in a counter-clockwise circle. </p>
		<p>padding: #px #px #px #px;</p>
		<p>Well, that about covers margins, borders, and padding. Thanks for reading.</p>
