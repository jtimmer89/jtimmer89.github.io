			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<br>
			<p>In order to look at conflict and its causes to write this blog, I read through a couple different articles discussing conflict either generically or specifically in the workplace. I did not find anything that really jumped out at me. There were explanations of the causes, and most of it was pretty intuitive and made sense, but it didn’t seem much deeper than stating that conflict happens when one person is a jerk to another or two people both need the same thing and they aren’t willing to let the other person go first. Following, I want to consider conflict in a way that I have looked at it personally in the last couple years as it relates to expectations and styles of communication. Conflict is most poignant for differing expectations and different communication styles. Understanding another’s expectations and preferred style of communication can go a long way in allowing for productive conflict. </p>

			<h2>Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Recently, I was feeling frustrated with a friend regarding a cycle I had seen in our friendship over the last year. I would tell him something about when to meet or what I wanted to do, and I would consistently find him asking about these details a day or even a couple minutes later. I have made comments like, “Hey, the plan is still the same as when we talked about it last,” but he never seemed to pick up on the fact I was getting frustrated by what seemed to be that he was never truly listening to me. There is no epic kind of finale to this story where we got in a fight and punched each other, but it bothered me enough to think about it and maybe even act a little distant when it happened.</p>

			<h2>What was the source of the conflict?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>The source of this conflict is fairly self-evident, but I would add the factor of my expectations. I expected him to listen to me and remember what I said, not a bad expectation. I never really shared this expectation, but I figured it was self-evident. That is the problem though. Nothing is really self-evident in some sense. The values that we carry define our expectations of others in relationship. Our values can seem obvious, and we can even expect everybody to be the same as we are. However, this is not really true. Just reading through other DBC boots in phase 0 discuss their values, it was interesting to see the varying values and how those values create expectations for others to act a certain way.</p>

			<h2>How did you handle that conflict?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Going back to this initial conflict, I decided that just feeling frustrated wasn’t very beneficial to our relationship. Rather than being accusational about what he had done, I just brought it up and asked him why he would keep asking about something we had already figured out. He told me that he worried about if he had heard right. He shared how as a kid, his mom would always tell him to listen better and that he had a problem with hearing right. He did his best to hear what the person was sharing but would not always be confident that he heard right. Ironically, I can totally understand this as I am quite the space case myself. Hearing that he was aware of the problem and wanting to confirm details was a way of coping helped me chill out a bit. I understood where he was coming from, and it has quickly become a non issue.</p>

			<h2>Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</h2>
			<br>
			<p> This was more of an internal conflict than an external one, but understanding where my friend was coming from brought closer friendship rather than one of the many little things that can create dissonance in friendship. Luckily, we happen to have very similar communication styles. I don’t happen to have a manifesto for the 9 styles of communication, but what I do know is that I see people all around me saying one thing when it is interpreted very differently by another. I could have asked why he would bring up things we already discussed and had that interpreted as an attack. One important ingredient for different communication styles has been my belief that even if something is wrong from my vantage point, what they are feeling is valid, and I can validate their feeling without selling myself short. I can listen and even repeat what they are saying before I quickly run to share what I am feeling before even discussing what is being said by the other person.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>As humans, conflict is pretty inevitable. It can be really painful. Bad conflict experiences can make us apprehensive about future conflict, but a successful conflict can make us excited about how conflict can impact a bad situation positively and even lead to relational intimacy and satisfaction. I believe in hearing and understanding what somebody is saying, asking clarifying questions, and even repeating what you think is being said before sharing “your side of the tale.” This can go a long way, and with enough successful conflict, we can create a streak of positive conflict. That is a really positive thing. Something that can change the world. It seems to me that part of the premise of DBC is that technology projects fail for human dynamics, not technical ability. I would say that positive conflict is a domino needed for just this issue.</p>
