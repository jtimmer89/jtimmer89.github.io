			<h2>The Problem of Tech Culture</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I found the article "Technology's Man Problem" by <em>Claire Cain Miller</em> to be the opening of a rabbit hole for my own research pointing to the issues that women face in the culture of the tech world. I want to first summarize this article before diving into some of my own thoughts on the topic. The article focused on the experience of Elissa Shevinsky who watching a TechCrunch hackathon while David Boulton and Jethro Batts presented their app called Titstare which was made to take picture of your face while you were staring at a some unsuspecting breasts. Elissa, upset with the app and its generous reception, went to the internet to blog about the problem. The next day, she found a tweet from her business partner supporting the app. She later quit from the company they were working on together. Elissa got a slew of threats and negative messages for her blog post.</p>

			<p>How is this type of regressive culture so standard in the tech world that is arguably the most progressive field there is? I have spent the last couple years working in the food industry with my sister. We are part of a small family business that exists in a larger ecosystem that is dominated by men. I have watched her become a resource and an exceptional employee that our co-workers are beginning to respect, but she has had to fight a much harder battle than my own to earn respect and have a place at the table. Even now, I doubt that she feels part of the gang or that she doesn’t have to fight for every idea she wants to see happen. This topic is obviously one that deserves another 100 pages to really consider, but I do want to throw out some ideas I have that might push back against this huge cultural issue.</p>

			<h2>Where to Begin?</h2>
			<br>
			<p>I remember reading a book as a philosophy student that talked about minimizing issues so they could really be dealt with. The idea is that if racism is not a big issue, you have 80% of people who are honest about their racism. If you put a lot of hype around the issue of racism and how bad it is, you get about 10% of people who are honest about their racism. Point being, there is a very fine line anybody walks pursuing change where you are trying to both create the space for honesty but also move forward and see change happen. So, how do you both minimize the issue of women in the tech world and help people take it more seriously to actually see the wackiness of their ways?</p>
			<br>
			<p>I don’t really know, but the movie <em>Her</em> comes to mind. I love how this movie legitimately made people consider the future of technology and even the possibility of having a relationship with a computer. I enjoyed the conversations I had after the movie, especially the use of Facebook and the relationships people have through Facebook. I personally have a problem to some extent with social media and the presentation of your life through the moments that you choose to share with others. Friendship is built through sharing the moments you would never share on social media. That’s another topic, but the idea here is to begin creating legitimate films that consider the loneliness of being marginalized in an industry and the power we have to change that. So...get on that Hollywood.</p>

			<h2>Pornography</h2>
			<br>
			<p>My final point is probably one of great disagreement, but I think it could be pivotal for the culture of the tech world. Pornography. Imagine an experience that creates a high similar to heroine in the brain but has lower immediate repercussions. Now put that on the internet for free. Let’s talk about the way that pornography programs you to think over time. It is a personal issue. It doesn’t seem to really affect anybody else. You don’t have to pay for it. Why even discuss it? But can we really allow ourselves to think this isn’t affecting the way we perceive relationships and relate to one another. If an average programmer spends his evenings looking at pornography and comes to work the next day, how is a person going to relate to the opposite sex that they have been watching be the object that does seemingly whatever the controlling party wants.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I think this must create dissension in relationships and confusion when people don’t act the way we want them to. Instead of having a healthy desire for differing opinions or actions that might frustrate us, pornography teaches a mentality of being served rather than serving others. Life is about more than getting everything to fit into our own little bubbles and paths. It is about getting disrupted and seeing the value in other ways of doing things. That is one way that innovation happens, and I think that pornography can create a mindset that hinders this type of working ecosystem. I obviously could spend a lot more time defending these different positions, but thus, it is only a wee blog.</p>
