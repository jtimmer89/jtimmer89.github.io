			<h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
			<br>
			<p>For the blogs that Dev Bootcamp asks that Boots write each week, their simple existence places emphasis on whatever topic they happen to choose. For this week, the topic is on asking questions. The technological world is one that exists on the basis of sharing knowledge through simple questions and answers seeking to create through web languages. Considering the questions you are asking and their effectiveness is a good thing to spend time on, but it has not really crossed my mind whether or not I have been asking good questions. I want to first discuss what a good question looks like and the environment a good question comes from before looking at the history of my posts in the Google+ community for DBC to explore how I have done so far. </p>
			<br>
			<p>What I call the environment of a question is the time that precedes the question. Given the depth of the question, there needs to be a worthy period of research to see what already exists in response to what you are seeking. Try a couple different ways of phrasing the question for example in google. You also don’t want to loose 5 hours seeking an answer. There should be a trigger that hints that it is time to ask for help and include some of your research to ask the question more fully. This moment when a question is necessary is what I would call the right environment for a question to be asked and received well. If you are in the right environment, then what do you ask? This is a great thing to think about because coming to programming, there are millions of questions that I have about everything. I have found myself at the point well past when it was time to ask a question, but looking at posts on Stack Overflow, there are so many variations of how questions are asked, and I really had no idea about what specifically to ask. Stack Overflow actually has the perfect summary on how to create a well crafted question <a class = "blog_link" href = "http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask"> here.</a> Rather than summing that up, I want to just summarize what makes a good question from my perspective and research. </p>
			<br>
			<p>The first and most important thing is to consider the culture you are entering as a newb programmer. Another great research for good question asking can be found <a class="blog_link" src ="http://catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html"> here.</a> In this article, the authors bring up the point that a good question is a blessing for someone who is genuinely interested in programming. The programmer enjoys understanding things completely and a good question could raise something they didn’t consider. However, a good question is the key phrase in that sentence. You may find hostility if you don’t do you own research and seek to discover the answer on your own. Questions shouldn’t be about quick answers but deeper understanding. Deeper understanding comes from wrestling and chewing on hard tasks on your own and asking questions after resolution cannot be found. As I develop as a programmer, I will become a resource for others and will take my own precious, personal time to help explain things to others because that is why I am entering programming, to help others and to understand things fully. However, will I want to help people looking for a quick way to solve their problem when they haven’t tried hard themselves to figure it out? No, that would make me angry. Thus, it makes sense that it is worth really considering why you are asking a question and considering what kind of questions you want to put out into the universe.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Based on this initial rant, when you ask a question, show that you have put in an effort to solve the problem, even if it is brief. Then give enough information that the problem can be recreated by another person based on what you have learned about its potential solution. How many times have I posted something without even reading it to ensure it makes sense? Too much. There are way too many words floating around on the internet. I think we need to think green. How can we minimize the massive amount of data floating around by making our questions more concise? What I suggest when asking a technical question to get the help you need, is to not be in a rush. Once it is formed using the guidelines on Stack Overflow, re-read the problem and consider your reader’s perspective. Do they have what they need to solve the problem with you? Is anything unnecessary or unhelpful? Take the time to make it better before posting. I haven't done so well asking questions in my Google+ career so far. My one technical question was one that I quickly answered. It looks like I failed at step 1, asking the question from the right environment. This is also a unique question asking environment in DBC phase 0 because we are all working on the same challenges which makes less detailed questions more possible. I think the main takeaway for me here is beginning to process a good question, doing enough research, and rereading the question before posting it, ensuring that it is giving enough information to be helpful and not too much to be concise. This also bring up the point of considering your audience and what they already know. I hope some of that helps. Good luck!</p>
