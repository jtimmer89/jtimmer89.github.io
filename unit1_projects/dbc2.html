		<h2>It looks yummy!</h2>
		<p>When you go to the store and look at a box of blueberries, they all seem pretty blue. However if you were to visit a farm, you would see all sorts of stuff coming out the field. The harvesters would be bringing in big brances, clumps of bright green berries, bugs, dirt, and many other odds and ends. It is a field. The question then reamins: how does it end up at the grocery store looking so neat?</p>
		<h2>How it got that way!</h2>
		<p>Consumers always buy based on appearance. Thus, we have found ourselves in the cult of appearances. Blueberries in particular run through a piece of sorting equipment that uses laser and camera imaging to deciper the good berries from the bad stuff. Once it decides something is bad, there are air jets that blow out the bad product before they are put into a container. That's how they end up looking so nice!</p>
