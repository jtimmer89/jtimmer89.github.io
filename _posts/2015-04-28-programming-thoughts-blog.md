#Slow Work, do what you're doing!

I have been doing some testing this morning of my MVC app with XUnit. I had a hard time getting started as it was all rather confusing, and there was a lot to take in - which framework to choose, unit testing, behavior driven development, controller testing, model testing, view testing, what testing should I do, where is testing the most valuable, do i need to mock things, what are my matchers, what should be tested, what is a waste of time, what to mock, what to stub, how to actually mock a request, session, etcâ€¦ I have all these thoughts swirling around, and I am just trying to get a single test to work. Once something is working, this is a beautiful crossroads. You can just move on and be relieved that it is working, or you can try and break it - testing assumptions. 

I think that it is easy to just move on, but the truth is that once you get something working, because you just followed instructions online probably, now is the opportunity to try and learn how it works by inputing different data and seeing what happens until you can predict the results. I think this is a powerful moment because it is so small. A developer could get in the habit of getting good at making things work without understanding them, or they could take the extra 5 minutes to test assumptions. This extra 5 minutes is the vitamins of programming. It is the part of the day where understanding is happening at 100x the other parts of the day trying to wire stuff up and get it to run. 

A programmer's day is mostly spent wiring things up, guesswork you might say, and there are maybe 5 - 6 moments where they can actually play with working code before moving on to the next challenge. I have been entering in to those moments recently, and it has been both a learning experience but it also opens up my mind for other things I don't understand to enter in my cluttered mind.
